My most recent project is based on René Magritte's 'Treachery of Images' - you know, 'this is not a pipe' with a picture of a pipe above it?

Ok, fine, just go [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images). I'll wait.

...

Good you're back.

Well, I decided to turn it on its head - through a combination of randomly generated true statements. Random colors, random font icons, their paired names, and Microsoft's translation api.

Plus there is a toggle, so now we can have it both ways - true statements or statements on representation - just as René intended.

###Technical Colophon:

Sass,
Bootstrap,
Microsoft Translator API,
Node.js,
request.js,
fontello,
forever,
and Yeoman (for the scaffolding)


A demo of the project is avialable [here](http://william.kamovit.ch/Rectifying-Rene/)
