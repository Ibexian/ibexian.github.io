==========
My personal site built using Webpack 2, Jekyll, Bootstrap, the ["Clean-blog" template](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll), ThreeJS, and Mapbox

The build system for the site is based off of:
- [Sweet-spot](https://github.com/hangar51/sweet-spot) - which combines Jekyll and Webpack while still working for Github Pages
- The [Webpack 2 Treeshaking Demo](https://github.com/rauschma/tree-shaking-demo)

##### Installation

```bash
$ bundle install
$ npm install
```

##### Development

When working on JS I run:

```bash
$ make webpack
```

And When working on HTML or CSS I run:

```bash
$ make jekyll
```
