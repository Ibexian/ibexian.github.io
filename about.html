<a href="/data/resume.pdf"><strong>Resume (PDF)</strong></a>

</p>William Kamovitch has spent time as a Front End Engineer, Project Manager, Tech Director, Researcher, Translator, and, in his youth, a Cherry Picker.</p>
</p>After leaving small town Elk Rapids, Will moved on to bigger (and sometimes better) things in Boston, DC, London, Beijing, and Changsha.</p>

<p>He's steeped in all things front end but he's at home anywhere in the full javascript stack - from Node up to Javascript MVCs (ember.js, React, and Backbone). In his spare time he builds useless web apps and twitter bots.</p>

<p><strong>Specialties:</strong> UI/UX Design, JavaScript Application Development</p>
